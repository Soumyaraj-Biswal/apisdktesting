Schematics Actions Workshop:


I am not sure what you are doing with your regex, but to me it does not look valid. If you want to test it out for yourself, try regex101.com

 Where to try- https://test.cloud.ibm.com/schematics/actions
 Docs - https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-action-setup

Examples: 
	https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aansible-playbook+org%3ACloud-Schematics&type=Repositories
    Deploying VSI start, stop and reboot(https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-vsi-start-stop)
    Provisioning LAMP stack(https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-provisioning-lamp-stack)
    Automating the application deployment(https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-iks-cluster)

Challenges :

Easy:

1. Run a simple ansible playbook like hello world with schematics action
   https://github.com/ansible/ansible-tower-samples

2. With inventory:
	Run a hello world on targeted VSI using inventory
	Create a schematics workspace with VSI’s. 
	Create the dynamic/static inventory for schematics actions using the workspace
	Run the hello world playbook on targeted VSI
        Doc: https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-inventories-setup
3. Use ansible roles to install kubectl on a targeted VSI

Medium:

Run VSI instance actions start/stopPrereq: VSI’s in the IBM Cloud account

https://github.com/Cloud-Schematics/ansible-is-instance-actions

Hard:

Run Lampstack or app deployment on IKS
Prereq: 
IKS cluster in Cloud account
VSI’s to provision the lamp stack

Inventory: Create a schematics workspace with VSI’s infrastructure. Create the dynamic inventory for schematics actions using the workspace
