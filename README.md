# Schematics API SDK testing tool

Let's share the purpose of the tool in the form of a story: Schematics team has developed around 250 APIs to communicate with various IBM Cloud services. These 250 APIs contains description, requests, responses, error handling codes, and sample examples to support the requests and response. The sample examples are with the requests and response syntax supports multiple languages such as Curl, Go, Java, Node, Python.

Interesting part is generating samples example to support multiple languages is the sample examples codes are autogenerated by using a tool. The Schematics team tests and executes each API that are generated for all the 250 APIs and publishes the examples to the end users.

## Requirement

Now, the requirement is to retest all the 250 APIs with the request and response to maintain th quality of the API examples. Retesting each of the API by copying the generated code takes enormous resource time. to overcome the development and resource time. You need to create a script to use the generated code from the geenrated API code file and perform the test in one go.

Sample generated example files for multiple languages are located [here](/data/input)

## Scenario

Testing the example code snippets by building individual test cases for API docs in all 4 multiple languages like Go, Python, Java and Node respectively. Testing can be built on basis of taking example code snippets and execute them in different models like web application or automation test suits.

Building test web application covers all the example code snippets using any backend language or script language covering the published in one API Docs. 

The Web application would have all the relevant test examples build on similar domain For example: Node, Python, Java and Go. Application would be in a responsive method passing the required parameter and covering the maximum results with compare to API Docs. This method of testing requires valid input / output parameters to execute all the example code relevant to multiple APIâ€™s following with their dependency. 

If you create workspace a workspace ID is created, and use the workspace ID as input to get or update or delete workspace details. Once all the CRUD of an API executes successfully through the relevant application language. This should a step by step process where all the APIs example code can be retrieved automatically and execute the API examples.

The entire web application would be an automation test suites that run the API examples and it should be an covering examples of all languages and returns response.
