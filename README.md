# Schematics API SDK testing tool

Testing the example code snippets by building individual test cases for API docs in all 4 Multiple languages like GO, Python, Java and Node respectively. Testing can be built on basis of  taking example code snippets and execute them in different models like web application or automation test suits.

Building test web application covers all the example code snippets using any backend language or script language covering the published in one API Docs. 

The Web application would have all the relevant test examples build on similar domain For example: Node, Python, Java and Go. Application would be in a responsive method passing the required parameter and covering the maximum results with compare to API Docs. This method of testing requires valid input / output parameters to execute all the example code relevant to multiple API’s following with their dependency. 

If you create workspace a workspace ID is created, and use the workspace ID as input to get or update or delete workspace details. Once all the CRUD of an API executes successfully through the relevant application language. This should a step by step process where all the APIs example code can be retrieved automatically and execute the API examples.

The entire web application would be an automation test suites that run the API examples and it should be an covering examples of all languages and returns response.
